# Fork Details

This repository is forked to add suffixes to contracts, interfaces and libraries within the `@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package` package.

This prevents non-unique identifier clashes, and therefore makes it possible to use upgradeable and non-upgradeable smart contracts from OpenZeppelin within one project.

Otherwise, the repository should stay even with [OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-ethereum-package](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-ethereum-package).

## OpenZeppelin Contracts Ethereum Package

[![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package)

**OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development.** It provides implementations of standards like ERC20 and ERC721 which you can deploy as-is or extend to suit your needs, as well as Solidity components to build custom contracts and more complex decentralized systems.

This fork of OpenZeppelin is set up as a **reusable Ethereum Package**. It is deployed to the kovan, rinkeby, and ropsten test networks, as well as to the main Ethereum network. You can reuse any of the pre-deployed on-chain contracts by simply linking to them using the [OpenZeppelin CLI](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli), or reuse their Solidity source code as with the [vanilla version of OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts).

## Differences with OpenZeppelin Contracts

This package contains the same contracts as the vanilla [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/openZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts), but modified for use with upgradeable contracts. The main difference is that _all contracts in this package are potentially upgradeable_: you will notice that no contracts have constructors defined, but use [initializer functions](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades/writing-upgradeable#initializers) instead. Also, this package is set up as an Ethereum package, and provides a small set of pre-deployed logic contracts that can be used directly via the OpenZeppelin SDK, without needing to deploy them again.

All contracts have an `UpgradeSafe` suffix to avoid confusion with their counterparts in OpenZeppelin Contracts. For example, `ERC20` becomes `ERC20UpgradeSafe`.

All in all, **you should use this package instead of @openzeppelin/contracts if you are creating upgradeable contracts**.

## Install

```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package
```

## Deployed logic contracts

- [ERC20PresetMinterPauserUpgradeSafe]: ERC20 token with minter and pauser roles
- [ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoIdUpgradeSafe]: ERC721 non-fungible token with minter and pauser roles, as well as incremental ids

## Using via the OpenZeppelin CLI

You can easily create upgradeable instances of any of the logic contracts listed above using the OpenZeppelin CLI. This will rely on the pre-deployed instances in mainnet, kovan, ropsten, or rinkeby, greatly reducing your gas deployment costs. To do this, just [create a new OpenZeppelin CLI project](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/getting-started) and [link to this package](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/dependencies#linking-the-contracts-ethereum-package).

```bash
$ mkdir mytoken && cd mytoken
$ npm init -y
$ npm install @openzeppelin/cli
$ npx oz init
$ npx oz link @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package
> Installing...
$ npx oz deploy @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/ERC20PresetMinterPauserUpgradeSafe
```

To deploy a contract, use the `openzeppelin deploy` command.

As an example, you can run the following to deploy an upgradeable ERC20 named MyToken, with symbol MYT and 18 decimals, with the deployer being a Minter and a Pauser.

```
$ npx oz deploy

? Pick a network development
? Pick a contract to deploy @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/ERC20PresetMinterPauserUpgradeSafe
✓ Deploying @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package dependency to network dev-1589433413492
All implementations are up to date
? Call a function to initialize the instance after creating it? Yes
? Select which function initialize(name: string, symbol: string)
? name: string: MyToken
? symbol: string: MYT
✓ Setting everything up to create contract instances
✓ Instance created at 0x59d3631c86BbE35EF041872d502F218A39FBa150
To upgrade this instance run 'oz upgrade'
0x59d3631c86BbE35EF041872d502F218A39FBa150
```

OpenZeppelin will create an upgradeable ERC20 instance and keep track of its address in the `.openzeppelin/<network>.json` file. Should you update your version of the openzeppelin contracts ethereum package later down the road, you can simply run `npx oz upgrade` to upgrade your ERC20 instances to the latest version.

You can also deploy an ERC721 token by choosing the `ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoIdUpgradeSafe` contract when running `npx oz deploy`. Refer to the `initialize` function of each of the predeployed logic contracts to see which parameters are required for initialization.

## Extending contracts

If you prefer to write your own custom contracts, import the ones from this package and extend them through inheritance. Note that **you must use this package and not `@openzeppelin/contracts` if you are [writing upgradeable contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades/writing-upgradeable)**.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.2;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/contracts/Initializable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/contracts/presets/ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId.sol";


contract MyNFT is Initializable, ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoIdUpgradeSafe {
    function initialize() public initializer {
        ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoIdUpgradeSafe.initialize(
            "MyNFT",
            "MYN",
            "https://example.com/token/"
        );
    }
}
```
